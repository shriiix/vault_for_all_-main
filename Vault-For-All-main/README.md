# üí°Inspiration
Our inspiration for this project came from Paytm's Voice Box, which is commonly found in stores in India to facilitate UPI payments. The Voice Box plays audio to confirm that the user has received a payment. However, despite the popularity of DeFi and crypto payments online, very few people use crypto payments offline, at least in India.

To address this issue, we have built "VaultForAll," a crypto payment tool that works on the Ethereum Environment. It aims to promote the use of crypto payments in shops and stores. This tool can play audio through Amazon Alexa to confirm that the user has received a payment. This provides a more secure and efficient way of making payments, as well as promotes the use of cryptocurrency for offline payments.

To further encourage users to adopt crypto payments, we are also sending out NFTs or non-fungible tokens to users on transactions. These NFTs serve as collectibles and can be used to purchase goods or services on our platform.

Join us on this exciting journey to revolutionize the Ethereum payment experience and incentivize users with valuable NFTs.


# ‚öôÔ∏è What it does
Introducing our cutting-edge payments wallet designed for Web3 and blockchain-based payments. Our wallet offers a secure and convenient way for users to make payments using cryptocurrencies, tokens, and other blockchain-based assets.

What sets our payments wallet apart is its integration with Amazon Alexa, which provides users with real-time notifications about their transactions. This feature is particularly useful for businesses, as they can quickly confirm whether they have received payment from their customers.

But that's not all - we are also offering payment rewards in the form of NFTs. These NFTs can be redeemed by users for a range of exciting gifts, coupons, and reward points, or even traded with other users. This unique feature sets us apart from other payment wallets in the market and provides users with an added incentive to use our platform.

Our payments wallet is simple to use, and secure and offers a range of innovative features. Whether you're an individual looking to make fast and easy payments using blockchain-based assets, or a business looking to streamline your payment processes, our wallet is the perfect solution for you. Join us today and experience the future of payments!


# üõ†Ô∏è How we built it
"VaultForAll" is a game-changer in the world of crypto payments. It aims to promote the use of cryptocurrency for offline payments and provides a secure, efficient, and convenient way of making transactions. With the added incentive of NFTs, we hope to encourage more people to adopt crypto payments and join us on this exciting journey. Thank you for watching, and we hope to see you soon on "VaultForAll!"

Firstly, the solution uses Push Protocol sockets SDK to monitor on-chain transactions related to a particular user's account. This allows the system to track any incoming transactions to the user's wallet or address in real time.

Once a transaction event is detected, the system uses Amazon Alexa's NotifyMe Skill to generate voice notifications that are sent to Amazon Echo devices. This enables users to receive audible alerts when there are incoming transactions to their wallet, thereby providing a more convenient way to stay informed about the status of their transactions.

Next, the system utilizes Filecoin and Web3.storage service to store rewards cards as NFTs on the Filecoin network. This is done by minting these NFTs on the Polygon network. Filecoin is a decentralized storage network that allows users to store data on a secure and decentralized platform, while Web3.storage is a service that makes it easier to interact with the Filecoin network.

Lastly, the entire system is built using React.js and TypeScript. React.js is a popular front-end development framework that enables developers to create complex user interfaces using a component-based architecture, while TypeScript is a programming language that enhances JavaScript with additional features such as static typing, which helps catch errors earlier in the development process.




# ‚ö†Ô∏èChallenges we ran into
It is our first time working with Ethereum and Hardware together. So we face lots of issues with it and never did this before and we couldn't find any blogs, docs, or tutorials. 
The second issue we faced with integrating the EVM chain with the frontend because we have never done it before.
We were planning to use QuickNode and Livepeer, but we could implement them due to time and lack of experience as well as time. 



# üë©‚Äçüíºüßë‚Äçüíª Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to make this project functional and working to help people and the Ethereum ecosystem in a certain manner.
We are immensely proud of achieving a good team contribution with each of the members who have in contributed to the project in some way or another.
We're very pleased with the end result.



# ‚öì What we learned
We learned that it can be frustrating at times to try to learn an entirely new thing and software as a team. But it was also, really, really fun, the most important things are to remember we're all in this together, and to never give up. Some bugs take a lot of time to fix but we just gotta try and try until we succeed. we gotta put in our 100%, at the end of the day it doesn't matter if we lose or win, what matter is did we give our best.
